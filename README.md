## Overview
This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Brazilian rental properties to identify key trends in pricing, neighborhood characteristics, 
property features, and availability. The goal is to support business decision-making in the rental market through data-driven insights.

## Business Objective
-Analyze the impact of property size, neighborhood, and features on rental prices
-Discover trends in the availability of properties by type and location
-Provide actionable insights to optimize real estate strategies

## Key Insights 
**Price Trends**:
Properties between R$ 400,000 - R$ 600,000 dominate the dataset.
Larger properties and those with more garage spaces have higher prices.

**Neighborhood Comparison**:
Vila Verde properties tend to be more expensive, while Jardim Sol properties are relatively cheaper.

**Garage Spaces and Prices**:
Properties with more garage spaces have higher prices, though this effect plateaus after 2 spaces.

**Sunlight and Traffic**:
Higher sunlight incidence and lower vehicle traffic are associated with higher prices.

## Next Steps:
Clustering: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment properties by price, size, and location.
Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict property prices based on features like neighborhood, size, and garage space.
